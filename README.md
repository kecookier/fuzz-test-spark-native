# Spark Native Engine Fuzz Testing

This is a fuzz testing framework for the Spark Native Engine. It is mostly copied from [datafusion-comet/fuzz-testing](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/tree/main/fuzz-testing).

I use it to test the popular spark native engines:
- [Datafusion Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet)
- [Blaze](https://github.com/kwai/blaze/)
- [Gluten](https://github.com/apache/incubator-gluten)
